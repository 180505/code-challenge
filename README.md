The MySQL challenges are placed on `/sql` dir and they are divided in a single file per question:

 * 1_ranking.sql
 * 2_initcap.sql
 * 3\_split\_column.sql
 * 4\_bug\_tracking.sql

The Java algorithm can be found in the package `com.marcosbarbero.demo`:

Each of them has an own class test to validate the methods.
